# 🎯 Discriminative Models

Machine Learning (ML) has progressed significantly with the advent of **Deep Learning** and **Transformer Architecture**, providing two prime categories:

- **Discriminative (Predictive) AI**
- **Generative AI**

---

## 🧠 Discriminative AI

Discriminative AI excels in **categorization** and **spotting decision boundaries** in data to predict outcomes.

### 📌 Examples of Discriminative Models:
- Decision Trees  
- Linear Regression  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

---

## 🎨 Generative AI

Generative AI shines in **creating new data** that resembles the input data.

### 📌 Examples of Generative Models:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

## 🧪 Choosing Between Generative and Discriminative AI

The right choice depends on:

- **Task Complexity** – Creative generation vs. outcome prediction  
- **Data Quality** – Clean labeled data vs. large unlabeled datasets  
- **Computational Resources** – Generative models typically require more
