### 2️⃣ Explainability: AI Shouldn’t Be a Black Box
Users should be able to ask: “Why did the AI make this decision?” And get a clear answer.

### 3️⃣ Privacy & Security: Protect Personal Data
AI should never misuse or leak data. Users deserve control and protection over what’s collected.

### 4️⃣ Transparency: No Hidden Algorithms
AI should clearly communicate how it works, its purpose, and its limitations.

### 5️⃣ Robustness: Be Ready for the Unexpected
AI should continue to function correctly even when things go wrong or inputs are unpredictable.

### 6️⃣ Governance: Follow Rules and Ethics
AI must align with laws, industry regulations, and ethical standards to prevent misuse and harm.

### 7️⃣ Safety: Avoid Harm
AI used in medicine, transportation, or finance must be thoroughly tested to protect lives and livelihoods.

### 8️⃣ Controllability: Humans Stay in Charge
Humans should always be able to monitor, correct, or shut down AI when necessary.
