# 🧠 Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## 💡 What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human-like reasoning and cognitive functions in computer systems. The aim is to build systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:

- 🔍 Recognizing patterns  
- 🗣️ Understanding speech  
- 🧠 Making decisions  
- 📈 Predicting outcomes

## 🧍 Human Intelligence vs. Artificial Intelligence

### 🧠 Human Intelligence

Human beings learn from experience by:
1. Taking in information (input)
2. Processing and understanding it
3. Making decisions based on past knowledge
4. Acting accordingly

> **Example**: Learning not to touch a hot stove after getting burned.

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence

AI attempts to replicate this process by:
1. Receiving **data** as input
2. Using **algorithms** to process and learn from the data
3. Making decisions based on the learned information
4. Performing **actions** aligned with specific tasks

> **Example**: A streaming platform uses AI to:
> - Analyze your viewing habits  
> - Compare them with other users  
> - Recommend shows or music  
> - Continuously improve recommendations as more data is collected
