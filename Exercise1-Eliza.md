# 💬 ELIZA Chatbot Exercise

## 🧠 Lesson Overview

**ELIZA** is one of the earliest examples of an AI-based chatbot, created in the 1960s. It was designed to simulate a conversation using pattern recognition and rule-based responses.

A popular version of ELIZA acted as a **therapist**, often reflecting a user's statements back at them. This simple behavior made it feel surprisingly human to many early users.

## 🧪 Exercise: Simulating a Conversation with ELIZA

In this exercise, you'll interact with an ELIZA-like chatbot and analyze how it constructs responses based on your input.

### 🔗 Step 1 - Meet ELIZA
Visit the [ELIZA Therapist Bot](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html) (provided by Ant & Max Hay).

Start your conversation with a basic greeting, such as:
Hello, ELIZA.

### 💬 Step 2 - Chat and Observe

Experiment with different types of input:
- Share a feeling:
I feel happy today.

- Ask a question:
What should I do now?

- Make a statement:
I am worried about my exams.


📌 **Observe how ELIZA responds.** Try a variety of phrases to explore how it reacts to emotional expressions, questions, and statements.

### 🔍 Step 3 - Detect Patterns

Analyze ELIZA's responses and consider:
- What **keywords** does it seem to react to?
- How does it structure its replies?
- Are there repeated **patterns** or rules it seems to follow?

> ELIZA uses:
> - **Pattern Matching**: Identifies words or phrases in your input.
> - **Rules-Based Responses**: Responds based on predefined templates or scripts tied to those patterns.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Pattern Matching**: Recognizing specific words or phrases in input text.
- **Rules-Based Systems**: Predefined instructions that trigger particular responses based on identified patterns.

## 📝 Summary

This exercise illustrates the foundational principles of early AI and chatbot development. ELIZA may be simple, but it demonstrates how rule-based AI can create engaging, human-like interactions using just pattern recognition and scripted logic.
