# 🧠 Enabling Computers to Learn and Decide

Both **Human Intelligence (HI)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** focus on how information is processed to make decisions. While humans do this naturally, AI aims to replicate this process using machines.

For example, identifying your favorite song involves processing different types of data:

- 🎵 Sound
- 📝 Lyrics
- 🎤 Artist
- 📺 Music video
- 🔠 Title
- 🔁 Similarity to other songs

This lesson explores how **Machine Learning (ML)** allows computers to learn from data and make decisions — such as identifying a song's artist with increasing accuracy.

## 📘 Key Terms and Concepts

### 🔹 Human Intelligence (HI)
The natural ability of humans to process complex information and make decisions based on experience, emotion, and reasoning.

### 🔹 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The effort to build machines that replicate human-like thinking, reasoning, and decision-making processes.

### 🔹 Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to **learn from data** and **improve performance over time** without being explicitly programmed.

### 🔹 Data Points
Discrete pieces of information that are used by machines (or humans) to evaluate a situation and make informed decisions.

### 🔹 Certainty
The degree of confidence in a machine’s prediction or decision based on the data it has processed.
